# Regularized-logistic-regression

I implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.

I have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, I would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
